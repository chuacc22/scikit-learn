This is an easier way to run the nosetests if you have already installed Anaconda

->Open any CLI (typically Git Bash)
->cd to the directory of where you installed Anaconda
->type in the command: "conda install nose"
->After you have successfully installed nose, make you also have 
  scikit-learn installed by running the command: "conda install scikit-learn".
  If you already installed the packages, the location of packages in environment
  will be shown
->after that, simply run the command: "nosetests -v sklearn" under the directory where
  you have scikit-learn installed
